TOP First project

This project will be to create a bare bones website, and serves as the first project along my TOP journey. After completing the project I will reflect on what I have learnt.

Reflection: My previous knowledge in HTML has certainly aided me in getting me up to speed quickly with minimal effort, that being said the ability to use github, maybe not very efficiently but still to be able to use it has been something that I have always wanted to be able to do but not been able to. I have clearly been able to overcome that hurdle.

I was able to do all of the project without needing to look back at the previous lessons for the code, however did need to look back for git commands only once. Whilst I know its encouraged to look back and use your resources I still value having a strong foundation.
