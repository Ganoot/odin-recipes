    <h2>What is Yamista?</h2>
    <p>These Greek stuffed vegetables, called "Yamista,” are filled with a delicious mixture of rice, oregano, onion and garlic baked in a rich tomato sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 large ripe tomatoes</li>
        <li>4 large green bell peppers</li>          
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>         
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>          
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced, or to taste</li>           
        <li>2 pounds ground beef chuck</li>           
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>           
        <li>1 tablespoon seasoned salt</li>           
        <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>            
        <li>½ cup water</li>            
        <li>1 ½ cups converted (parboiled) rice (such as Uncle Ben's®)</li> 
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut off tops of tomatoes, leaving a corner still attached to create a lid. Scoop out insides of tomatoes and transfer to a large bowl; squeeze juices out of tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Cut off tops of green peppers and reserve for later use; scoop out seeds and membranes.</li>
        <li>Arrange tomatoes and bell peppers in an 11x17-inch baking dish.</li>            
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>          
        <li>Heat butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in the melted butter until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add ground beef, soy sauce, seasoned salt, and black pepper. Cook until beef is browned and crumbly, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>          
        <li>Mix squeezed tomato insides and water into browned beef mixture; bring to a simmer and cook for about 15 minutes. Add rice and bring to a boil; remove skillet from heat.</li>            
        <li>Spoon beef-rice mixture into tomatoes; place tops onto filled tomatoes and arrange them into the baking dish with lid sides down.</li>           
        <li>Stuff bell peppers with beef-rice mixture and top with reserved lids; lay bell peppers sideways in the baking dish. Pour olive oil over stuffed tomatoes and bell peppers; season with salt and pepper.</li>           
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Turn bell peppers and continue baking until bell peppers and tomatoes are softened, about 30 more minutes.</li>
    </ol>
